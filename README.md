I'm an Enterprise Content Management specialist. I'm working at [Lumapps](www.lumapps.com) in the Sales Engineering team. I'm an all-round worker, with the will to share my knowledge, best practices, tips and tricks to speed up any application implementations. I'm not a developer expert, and my contributions can be probably easily improved. That said... I can do few cool things with JS, CSS, HTML, Python, Web Components and React :wink:
